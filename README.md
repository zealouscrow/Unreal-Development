# Unreal Development
I am learning C++ within the framework of the Unreal Engine and its best practices, working from [The Unreal Engine Developer
Course - Learn C++ and Make Games](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/overview) taught by Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi. I chose this in particular so that I could learn the language in context of something I am interested in - game development.

Over time I will update this repository with my work from this course. I am pushing to think for myself, so in places code will deviate
from what is written by the instructor. This README will serve as an indicator of what I have included so far.

### Section 02:
+ Covering fundamental C++ skills in the context of a simple word game, Bulls and Cows. 
+ Includes methods, loops, continual refactoring and eventually use of ASCII art.
+ Emphasises good practices in terms of namespaces and code clarity.
